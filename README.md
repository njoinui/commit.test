Notes:
1. I used SCSS, Foundation, Ramda, Gulp and a little bit of ES6 without Babel
2. I decided not to include time/date for brevity sake (as well as other refinements)
3. I choose SCSS over Less as it is more widely accepted
4. I choose Ramda over Underscore or Lodash as it is modern functional approach
5. I choose to use directives over component because in AngularJS component are no more than than syntactic sugar and I have more experience with directives
6. PLEASE NOTE: Since the 'male' and 'female' are only one degree apart, in many cases there are no changes in the list order
